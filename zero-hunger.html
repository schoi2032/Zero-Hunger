                <h2>The Reality of Hunger</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    According to the UN, nearly 10% of the world population goes to bed hungry. The goal of Zero Hunger
                    is not just about providing food, but ensuring access to nutritious and sustainable food sources for
                    everyone. Hunger is a complex cycle that affects health, education, and economic growth. When
                    children are malnourished, they cannot learn effectively; when adults are hungry, they cannot work
                    productively. This trap of food insecurity spans generations, locking entire communities into
                    poverty. Addressing this requires a holistic approach that looks at supply chains, policy, and
                    social justice.

                <h4 style="color: var(--color-primary);">1. Availability</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">The supply of food through production, distribution, and exchange. This
                    pillar ensures that sufficient quantities of food are physically available in a given location.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="border: 1px solid #e2e8f0; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">
                <h4 style="color: var(--color-primary);">2. Access</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">The affordability and allocation of food, as well as the preferences of
                    individuals and households. Food can be plentiful but still inaccessible if it is too expensive.</p>

                <h4 style="color: var(--color-primary);">3. Utilization</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">Metabolism of food by individuals (nutritional value, safety, and social
                    value). It's not just calories; the body must be able to absorb the necessary nutrients.</p>

                <h4 style="color: var(--color-primary);">4. Stability</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">The ability to obtain food over time, coping with sudden shocks or
                    cyclical events. True security means knowing where your next meal is coming from, always.</p>
            </div>

            <strong>Understanding the Interconnectedness:</strong> These four pillars do not function in isolation. For
            example, a country might have ample <em>Availability</em> of food (high production), but if <em>Access</em>
            is restricted due to poor infrastructure or high prices, food security is compromised. Similarly, food might
            be accessible, but if <em>Utilization</em> is poor due to lack of clean water or prevalence of disease,
            nutritional outcomes will remain low. Achieving Zero Hunger requires strengthening all four pillars
            simultaneously to ensure resilience against <em>Stability</em> shocks like climate change or economic
            downturns.

                <h3>Conflict</h3>
                <p>Conflict is the number one driver of hunger today. When violence erupts, it destroys the very
                    foundations of food systems: fields are mined, markets are bombed, and supply routes are blocked.
                    Families are forced to flee their homes, leaving behind their livelihoods and losing access to their
                    regular food sources.</p>

                <h3>Climate Change</h3>
                <p>The climate crisis is a hunger crisis. Extreme weather events like prolonged droughts and sudden
                    flash floods are becoming more frequent and intense. These shocks decimate crops, kill livestock,
                    and degrade the soil, making it increasingly difficult for farmers in vulnerable regions to grow
                    enough food.</p>

                <h3>Economic Inequality</h3>
                <p>Hunger is often a symptom of poverty. Even when food is available in markets, millions cannot afford
                    to buy it. Economic shocks, inflation, and global health crises (like the COVID-19 pandemic)
                    exacerbate this inequality, forcing the most vulnerable to skip meals just to survive.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p style="max-width: 900px; margin: 3rem auto 0 auto; line-height: 1.8; text-align: justify;">
            The persistence of hunger is rarely due to a global lack of food; we produce enough to feed everyone.
            Instead, it is a crisis of <strong>distribution and access</strong> driven by the "Three Cs": Conflict,
            Climate, and Cost. These drivers often feed into one another—climate change can trigger resource conflicts,
            which in turn destroy economies. Solving this requires not just humanitarian aid (giving food) but political
            solutions (stopping wars), environmental action (climate adaptation), and economic reform (fair wages and
            trade). Without addressing these root causes, we are merely treating the symptoms of a much deeper systemic
            failure.

        <h2 style="font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 2rem; line-height: 1.2;">The Paradox of Plenty: Why Production
            Isn't Enough</h2>

        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; text-align: justify;">
            We currently live in a world of unprecedented agricultural abundance. According to the Food and Agriculture
            Organization (FAO), global agriculture produces enough calories to feed every person on the planet
            approximately 2,900 calories per day. Yet, over 800 million people still go to bed hungry every night. This
            contradiction—known as the "Paradox of Plenty"—suggests that the historic focus on simply increasing crop
            yields has failed to solve the core problem of food insecurity.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; text-align: justify;">
            The breakdown occurs in the "last mile" of food systems. In the Global South, up to 40% of food is lost
            post-harvest due to inadequate storage, refrigeration, and transport infrastructure. Smallholder farmers,
            who produce the majority of the food in developing nations, often lack access to markets, forcing them to
            sell low or watch their harvest rot. Conversely, in the Global North, food is treated as a cheap commodity,
            leading to massive consumer waste. The result is a broken cycle where resources are extracted at a high
            environmental cost to produce food that never fulfills its purpose.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.9; text-align: justify;">
            Furthermore, the long-term economic impact of this hunger is staggering. Chronic malnutrition in childhood
            leads to stunting—a condition that permanently impairs physical and cognitive development. The World Bank
            estimates that stunting can reduce a country's GDP by up to 3%, creating a generational poverty trap that is
            nearly impossible to escape without external intervention. Addressing hunger is therefore not merely a moral
            imperative but an economic necessity for global stability.

                <h3><i class="fas fa-seedling" style="color: var(--color-primary);"></i> Sustainable Agriculture</h3>
                <p>Investing in smallholder farmers, who produce 80% of the food in developing nations, is crucial.
                    Techniques like crop rotation, drip irrigation, and drought-resistant seeds build resilience. By
                    empowering farmers with technology and fair trade access, we boost local economies.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3><i class="fas fa-carrot" style="color: var(--color-secondary);"></i> Reducing Waste</h3>
                <p>If we saved just one-fourth of the food currently lost or wasted, we could feed 870 million hungry
                    people. Improving storage facilities in developing nations and changing consumer habits in developed
                    ones is key to fixing this inefficient system.</p>

            <div>
                <h3><i class="fas fa-hands-helping" style="color: #4299e1;"></i> Social Safety Nets</h3>
                <p>School meal programs and cash transfers protect the most vulnerable. They ensure children get the
                    nutrition they need to learn and grow, breaking the cycle of poverty. Immediate relief programs act
                    as a buffer against economic shocks.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3><i class="fas fa-balance-scale" style="color: #805ad5;"></i> Gender Equality</h3>
                <p>If women farmers had the same access to resources as men, the number of hungry people in the world
                    could be reduced by up to 150 million. Empowering women leads to better nutritional outcomes for
                    entire families and communities.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p style="max-width: 900px; margin: 3rem auto 0 auto; line-height: 1.8; text-align: justify;">
            <strong>The Path Forward:</strong> These solutions are interconnected. We cannot solve hunger with
            agriculture alone; we need social policies to support it. Sustainable agriculture increases production, but
            safety nets ensure that the poorest can afford it. Gender equality amplifies the results of every other
            intervention. It is a collective effort requiring the cooperation of governments, private sector innovation,
            and individual advocacy. The goal of Zero Hunger is ambitious, but considering that the world produces more
            than enough food for everyone, it is achievable with the right political and social will.
